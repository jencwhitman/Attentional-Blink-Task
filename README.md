To run the experiment and see what it's like to be a participant, download
and install a free trial version of NBS Presentation software. 
Then double-click on ABv2.exp (on your machine's HD, not on github) to get started. 
To simply browse code, you can read the .pcl and .sce files in any text editor. 
The bulk of the programming happens in the pcl files.
